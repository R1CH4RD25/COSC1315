## Scripts Created

Location: `Project Documentation/Scripts/`

1. **`extract_all_mosh_lessons.py`**
   - Reads the master `CodeWithMosh_Lessons.md` file
   - Extracts individual lessons 1-18
   - Creates formatted markdown files
   - Maps lessons to course schedule weeks
   - Adds teaching note templates
