| **Self-Paced Difficulty** | HIGH - requires discipline, structure | LOWER - instructor-led, immediate help |
| **Technical Barriers** | LOWER - Chromebooks work with Colab | HIGHER - must have Windows laptop |
| **Help Availability** | LOWER - limited instructor time (Tech Director) | HIGHER - extensive office hours (7.5 hrs/week) |
| **Peer Support** | VERY LOW - only 3 students in class | MEDIUM-HIGH - full classroom of peers |
| **Resource Access** | HIGH - Colab, Mosh videos, self-service | MEDIUM - traditional classroom materials |

**Difficulty Factors:**

#### **Sullivan's Students Face HARDER Challenges:**
1. ‚ùå **Low motivation** (0.2/10 interest, placed not chosen)
2. ‚ùå **High school maturity** (less independent learning skills)
3. ‚ùå **Self-paced structure** (easy to procrastinate)
4. ‚ùå **Limited peer support** (3 students total)
5. ‚ùå **Senioritis** affecting younger grades
6. ‚ùå **Competing priorities** (sports, other classes)
7. ‚ùå **Minimal live instruction** (professor is Tech Director)

#### **Watson's Students Face EASIER Challenges:**
1. ‚úÖ **Self-selected** (chose to take course)
2. ‚úÖ **College maturity** (more independent learning)
3. ‚úÖ **Instructor-led** (immediate feedback, guided pace)
4. ‚úÖ **Peer support** (full classroom for collaboration)
5. ‚úÖ **Extensive office hours** (7.5 hours/week available)
6. ‚úÖ **Traditional structure** (clear expectations, in-class time)

**BUT:**

#### **Sullivan's Students Have ADVANTAGES:**
1. ‚úÖ **Clear schedule** (know exactly what's expected week-by-week)
2. ‚úÖ **Accessible platform** (Colab works on Chromebooks)
3. ‚úÖ **Quality video resources** (Code with Mosh)
4. ‚úÖ **Small class size** (1-on-1 attention when needed)
5. ‚úÖ **2-week late policy** (safety net for struggling students)
6. ‚úÖ **Grace period** (48 hours recommended)
7. ‚úÖ **Face-to-face 4 days/week** (despite online, still in-person support)

### **Which Course is Harder?**

| Aspect | Sullivan | Watson | Winner |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Content Difficulty** | Same textbook, same outcomes | Same textbook, same outcomes | üü∞ **TIE** |
| **Structural Difficulty** | Self-paced (harder for unmotivated) | Instructor-led (easier) | üëë **Watson Easier** |
| **Student Readiness** | High school, low motivation | College, self-selected | üëë **Watson Easier** |
| **Support Available** | 4 hrs office hours, 3 peers | 7.5 hrs office hours, full class | üëë **Watson Easier** |

| **Schedule Clarity** | High (detailed schedule) | Low (no schedule provided) | üëë **Sullivan Easier** |
| **Workload** | ~7-11 hours/week | ~10-15 hours/week | üü∞ **TIE** |

### **Overall Difficulty Verdict:**

**üèÜ WINNER (EASIER COURSE): Watson's Section**

**Why:**
- Traditional instructor-led format provides more support
- College students are more motivated and mature
- More office hours and peer support
