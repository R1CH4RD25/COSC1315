## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### STEP 1: Add Verification Folder (ONE TIME ONLY) ‚≠ê

1. Click this link: **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rdngjz1JtlRMHz7X_S_rFBRLEzQgXqfT**
2. You'll see a folder called "Verifications"
3. Click the **‚≠ê "Add shortcut to Drive"** button at the top of the page
4. Select **"My Drive"** (or any location you prefer)
5. Click **"Add shortcut"**

‚úÖ **Done!** You only need to do this ONCE for the entire semester.

---

### STEP 2: Open a Lesson Notebook

1. Go to the course folder (link provided in Canvas/LMS)
2. Find the lesson you're working on:
   - Example: `Lesson_03_Variables_WalkAlong.ipynb`
3. Click **File ‚Üí "Save a copy in Drive"**
4. The copy opens automatically in Google Colab

üí° **Tip:** Save it to YOUR Google Drive so you can work on it anytime!

---

### STEP 3: Run the Setup Cell

1. Find **Cell 2** (the big cell at the top with lots of code)
2. Click inside it and press **Shift + Enter** (or click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button)
3. You'll see: **"üìÇ Mounting Google Drive..."**
4. A popup appears - click **"Connect to Google Drive"**
5. Choose your Google account and click **"Allow"**
6. Wait a few seconds...
7. You should see: **"‚úÖ Verification system loaded!"**

‚úÖ **Ready!** You're all set to start coding.

---

### STEP 4: Complete the Tasks

Each lesson has multiple coding tasks:

1. **üì∫ Watch the video** - Mosh will show you how to code
2. **‚è∏Ô∏è Pause the video** after he finishes a task
3. **‚å®Ô∏è Type the code** yourself in the code cell
4. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run your code** - Press **Shift + Enter**
5. **‚úîÔ∏è Verify your work** - Run the verification cell below your code
6. **üéâ Get feedback** - See if you got it right!

**Example:**

```python
# Task: Create a variable called 'price' with value 10
price = 10
print(price)
```

Then run the verification:
```python
verify_task_1()
```

You'll see:
- ‚úÖ **"Perfect! You created the variable 'price' and assigned it the value 10."**
- OR ‚ùå **"Error: Variable 'price' not found."** (with a hint on what to fix)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Could not find Verifications folder!"

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you completed **STEP 1** (add shortcut to Drive)
2. Go back to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rdngjz1JtlRMHz7X_S_rFBRLEzQgXqfT
3. Click **"Add shortcut to Drive"** if you haven't already
4. Come back to Colab and **re-run Cell 2**

---

### ‚ùå "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lesson_03_verification'"

**Fix:**
1. Check that you added the Verifications folder (STEP 1)
2. In Colab, go to **Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime**
3. Re-run **Cell 2** (the setup cell)
4. Try the verification again

---

### ‚ùå "Variable 'price' not found" (but I created it!)

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you ran your code cell BEFORE running the verification cell
2. Check for typos - variable names are case-sensitive! (`Price` ‚â† `price`)
3. Look at your code - did you actually create the variable?
4. If stuck, ask in the discussion board!

---

### üîå "Connect to Google Drive" popup keeps appearing

**Fix:**
- This is normal the first time you run Cell 2
- Click **"Connect to Google Drive"** and **"Allow"**
- You only have to do this once per session
- If you close Colab and come back later, you'll need to run Cell 2 again

---

## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. **Type the code yourself** - Don't copy/paste!
   - Typing helps you learn
   - You'll remember the syntax better
   - Muscle memory is real!

### 2. **Run cells as you go**
   - Don't wait until the end
   - Test each task immediately
   - Fix errors before moving on

### 3. **Read the error messages**
   - Verification gives helpful hints
   - Errors tell you exactly what's wrong
   - Google the error if you're stuck

### 4. **Watch the video closely**
   - Pause after each task
   - Rewind if you missed something
   - Mosh explains WHY, not just HOW

### 5. **Use the discussion board**
   - Other students have similar questions
   - Share what you learned
   - Help each other!

## üìù What You're Learning

These Walk-Along notebooks teach you to:
- ‚úÖ **Watch** experts code (Mosh from "Code with Mosh")
- ‚úÖ **Practice** by typing code yourself
- ‚úÖ **Verify** your work instantly
- ‚úÖ **Learn** from mistakes with helpful feedback
- ‚úÖ **Build** real programming skills

**Goal:** By the end of the semester, you'll be able to write Python programs confidently!

## üéì Academic Integrity

### What's Allowed:
- ‚úÖ Watching Mosh's videos
- ‚úÖ Typing the code he demonstrates
- ‚úÖ Using the verification system
- ‚úÖ Asking classmates for help
- ‚úÖ Using Google/Stack Overflow for syntax help

### What's NOT Allowed:
- ‚ùå Copying someone else's completed notebook
- ‚ùå Sharing your answers before the deadline
- ‚ùå Using AI to write code for you (without learning)
- ‚ùå Submitting work you didn't understand

**Remember:** The goal is LEARNING, not just getting ‚úÖ checkmarks!
