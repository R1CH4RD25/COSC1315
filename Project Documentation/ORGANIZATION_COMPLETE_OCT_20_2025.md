**Quote from User:** *"I will never be able to go through all of those and I fear if you did again you might find the word in one document but miss the other, or not know which was real and which was out dated. Please go through ALL .md... remove outdated and make sure we have it all organized... a LOT of them are out of subfolders and im going crazy with my OCD!"*

**Mission Accomplished!** 🎯
