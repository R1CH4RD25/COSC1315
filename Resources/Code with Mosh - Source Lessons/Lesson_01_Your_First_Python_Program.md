## Original Video Transcript

Hello World folder and go to new Python file, call this file app.py. So by convention, all Python files should have this py extension. Alright, let's go ahead, now let's collapse this project panel by clicking here and write our first python program. Simply type print, pr int, all in lowercase, open and close parenthesis, and inside these parenthesis, add quotations we can either use single quotes or double quotes, now in between the codes write your name. I am Mosh Hamedani, so here, so this is your first Python programming. With these piece of code you can print your name on the screen. Now to run this, go on the top, under the run menu, click run, also note that there is a shortcut associated with this command, when I program I always use shortcuts because that increases my productivity. So here on a Mac computer, the shortcut is control, option, and R. On Windows it's different. So let's do that, now it's asking where you want to run this, click on app, down below, you should see this little terminal window, this is a little window into our program, so here you can see our results for output for our program. In the future as you learn more Python, you'll be able to build applications that have a graphical user interface, or gooey. That is a little bit complicated, so for now we're going to use this little terminal window to see the results of our program. So as you can see my name is printed here, now as you print code, this window might get in the way so always resize it or minimize itty putting this icon here, so this was our first python program. Now if you didn't see the result I showed you in this video, use the comment box below and tell me what error you encountered, I'll do my best to help you move forward.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

**Understand the fundamentals of Python programming**
- Explain that Python files use the `.py` extension by convention
- Describe the purpose of the `print()` function for displaying output
- Recognize that Python code produces results visible in a terminal or console window

**Write and execute a basic Python program**
- Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) in their development environment
- Use the `print()` function to display text on the screen
- Include text inside quotation marks (single `'` or double `"`) as function arguments
- Successfully run a Python program and view its output

**Use the print() function correctly**
- Call `print()` with proper syntax: `print("text")`
- Place text inside quotation marks within the parentheses
- Choose between single quotes `'text'` or double quotes `"text"` appropriately
- Remember that both quote styles are valid for simple strings

**Display personalized output**
- Print their own name using `print("Your Name")`
- Customize the message inside the `print()` function
- Understand that the text inside quotes appears exactly as written in the output

**Navigate a development environment**
- Locate and use the Run menu or run button to execute code
- Understand keyboard shortcuts improve productivity (though specifics vary by environment)
- Resize or minimize the terminal/console window as needed while coding
- Recognize that output appears in the terminal window after running code

**Recognize common pitfalls**
- Remember that **missing closing quotes** cause syntax errors (e.g., `print("text` is incomplete)
- Remember that **missing closing parentheses** prevent code from running (e.g., `print("text"` needs `)`)
- Ensure quotation marks match at the beginning and end of text
- Understand that Python is **case-sensitive** (e.g., `Print` is different from `print`)

## Key Terms

- **Python** — A high-level programming language known for readability and versatility
- **`.py` extension** — The file extension used for Python program files (e.g., `app.py`)
- **`print()` function** — A built-in Python function that displays text or values to the console/terminal
- **Function** — A reusable block of code that performs a specific task; `print()` is an example
- **Argument** — The value passed inside parentheses to a function (e.g., `"Hello"` in `print("Hello")`)
- **String** — Text data enclosed in quotation marks (`"text"` or `'text'`)
- **Quotation marks** — Symbols (`"` or `'`) used to define the beginning and end of text strings
- **Terminal/Console** — A window that displays the output of a program
- **Execute/Run** — To carry out or perform the instructions in a program
- **Syntax** — The rules and structure for writing valid code in a programming language
- **Syntax Error** — A mistake in code structure that prevents the program from running

## Walk-Along Coding Tasks

*These are the coding examples that Mosh demonstrates in the video. Follow along and type the code yourself.*

### Task 1: Print Your Name

**Description:** Create a Python program that prints your name to the screen using the print() function.

**Coding Task:**
```python
# Type your code below:
```

**Mosh's Solution:**
```python
print("Mosh Hamedani")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Mosh Hamedani
```
