## üéì PRIMARY COURSE GOALS

### **Official Goal (From Syllabus):**
> "The aim is to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals."

### **Translated for Your Context:**

**This is an EXPLORATION course, NOT a technical bootcamp.**

**Primary Goals:**
1. ‚úÖ **Expose students to programming** - What is it? What does it look like?
2. ‚úÖ **Build basic competency** - Can they write simple programs?
3. ‚úÖ **Develop confidence** - Can they feel "I can do this if I want to"?
4. ‚úÖ **Enable informed decision** - Should they continue to Programming I?
5. ‚úÖ **Award college credit** - Meet CCMR requirements for Texas HS

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Students complete assignments and earn credit ‚úÖ
- Students understand if programming interests them ‚úÖ
- Students can explain basic programming concepts ‚úÖ
- Students can modify existing code ‚úÖ
- 1-2 students discover genuine interest (bonus!) üéÅ

**What Success Does NOT Look Like:**
- All students becoming passionate coders ‚ùå
- Students building complex applications ‚ùå
- Students memorizing syntax ‚ùå
- Students pursuing CS careers ‚ùå
