## 🎯 END-OF-COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES

### **From Cisco College Syllabus:**

**Students should be able to:**
1. ✅ Design and develop algorithms to solve problems
2. ✅ Demonstrate understanding of software development methodologies (modular design, pseudocode, flowcharting)
3. ✅ Design, code, test, debug, and document computer programs
4. ✅ Apply programming concepts to new problems

**Core Competencies (THECB):**
- **Critical Thinking:** Analysis, evaluation, synthesis
- **Communication:** Written, oral, visual expression of ideas
- **Quantitative Skills:** Data manipulation and informed conclusions

**Practical Skills:**
- Write basic Python programs
- Use variables, input/output, type conversion
- Work with strings, lists, tuples
- Implement control flow (if, while, for loops)
- Debug syntax and logical errors
- Solve real-world problems with code

---

## 🚨 THREE CATCH-UP OPTIONS

### **Option 1: Aggressive Catch-Up** (Ideal but Challenging)
- **This Week:** Create Lessons 3-5
- **Next Week:** Create Lessons 6-8
- **Week After:** Create Lessons 9-11
- **Result:** Back on schedule by early November
- **Effort:** ~5-8 hours/week for 3 weeks

### **Option 2: Adjust Schedule** (Realistic)
- Combine related lessons to reduce total count
- Cut Lessons 16-18 (Tuples, advanced lists)
- Focus on core competencies (variables → loops → basic lists)
- **Result:** Complete course with reduced scope
- **Effort:** ~3-5 hours/week for 6 weeks

### **Option 3: Extended Grace Period** (Self-Paced)
- Issue all lessons now
- Students complete at own pace
- All due by December 4 (finals week)
- Weekly check-ins to monitor progress
- **Result:** Self-paced completion, higher risk of procrastination
- **Effort:** ~2-3 hours/week for 6 weeks

### **Workflow (1-2 hours per lesson):**
1. Get timestamp from VIDEO_SOURCES.md
2. Extract transcript using python script
3. Copy lesson template
4. Fill in sections (Watch, Goal, Key Terms, Walk-Along, Try It, Debug)
5. Use sports-themed examples
6. Add "I'm Stuck" protocol
7. Create 10-question quiz
