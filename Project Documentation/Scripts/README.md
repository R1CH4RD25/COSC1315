## üóëÔ∏è Removed Scripts (October 20, 2025)

The following scripts were removed as obsolete or broken:

- ‚ùå `add_all_objectives.py` - Had syntax errors, replaced by `add_objectives_to_lessons.py`
- ‚ùå `extract_syllabus.py` - One-time use script, task completed
- ‚ùå `create_mosh_lesson_files.py` - Replaced by `extract_all_mosh_lessons.py`

## üîß Dependencies

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api pdfplumber python-docx reportlab pypdfium2
```

## üìù Script Development Notes

### Best Practices Applied
1. **UTF-8 Encoding:** All scripts use `encoding='utf-8'` for file operations
2. **Error Handling:** Scripts check for existing content before adding duplicates
3. **Regex Patterns:** Use `re.DOTALL` for multiline content matching
4. **Verification:** Count and report results after operations
5. **Backup Strategy:** Test on single files before batch processing

### Lessons Learned
- Always check for existing content before inserting
- Use `## Key Terms` as duplicate check (more reliable than `## Learning Objectives`)
- Test regex patterns on small samples first
- Keep cleanup scripts even after use (helpful for future issues)
- Document what worked for future reference
