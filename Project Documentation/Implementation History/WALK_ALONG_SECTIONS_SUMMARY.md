# Walk-Along Sections Added to Code with Mosh Lessons

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully added "Walk-Along Coding Tasks" sections to all 18 Code with Mosh lesson source files. These sections identify and structure the specific coding examples that Mosh demonstrates in his video tutorials.

## Purpose

The Walk-Along sections serve multiple purposes:

1. **Clear Identification** — Students can easily identify which coding examples Mosh types during the video
2. **Structured Practice** — Each task has a clear title, description, starter code, solution, and expected output
3. **Colab Integration** — Format is designed for easy extraction into Google Colab notebook exercises
4. **Progressive Learning** — Students can follow along with Mosh's demonstrations step-by-step

## Format Structure

Each Walk-Along section follows this format:

```markdown
## Walk-Along Coding Tasks

*These are the coding examples that Mosh demonstrates in the video. Follow along and type the code yourself.*

### Task N: [Title]

**Description:** [What the student will learn/do]

**Coding Task:**
```python
# Type your code below:
```

**Mosh's Solution:**
```python
[The code Mosh writes in the video]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[What the code should produce]
```
```

## Placement in Files

Walk-Along sections are inserted after the **Key Terms** section and before the **Teaching Notes** section, maintaining the following structure:

1. Video Transcript
2. Learning Objectives
3. Key Terms
4. **Walk-Along Coding Tasks** ← New section added here
5. Teaching Notes

## Script Used

**Script:** `add_walk_along_sections.py`  
**Location:** `G:\My Drive\Colab Notebooks\COSC1315\Project Documentation\Scripts\`

### Key Features:
- Checks for existing Walk-Along sections to prevent duplicates
- Uses regex to find insertion point after Key Terms
- Formats output with proper markdown syntax
- Provides progress feedback during execution

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Walk-Along sections added (COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Extract "Try It Yourself" exercises (future task)
3. ⏳ Create Colab notebook templates from Walk-Alongs
4. ⏳ Generate assessment questions from exercises

## Design Decisions

### Why "Walk-Along" vs "Code-Along"?
- More descriptive: students "walk alongside" Mosh as he codes
- Distinguishes from exercises where students code independently
- Emphasizes the collaborative learning aspect

### Why Include Both Starter Code and Solution?
- **Starter Code:** Provides a blank template with comment prompt
- **Solution:** Shows exactly what Mosh types in the video
- Students can attempt independently, then compare with solution
- Easy to extract either version for Colab notebooks

### Why Show Expected Output?
- Students can verify their code works correctly
- Helps with debugging if output doesn't match
- Reinforces the concept of testing code
- Prepares students for unit testing concepts

## Validation

### Quality Checks Performed:
✅ All 18 lessons have Walk-Along sections  
✅ Section headers are consistent across all files  
✅ Python code blocks are properly formatted  
✅ Expected outputs match the code solutions  
✅ Descriptions are clear and concise  
✅ Tasks are numbered sequentially within each lesson  
✅ No duplicate sections created  

### Sample Verification:
```bash
# Count Walk-Along sections (should be 18)
grep -r "## Walk-Along Coding Tasks" "Code with Mosh - Source Lessons/" | wc -l
# Result: 18 ✅

# Verify proper placement (should be between Key Terms and Teaching Notes)
# Manually checked: ✅
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Transcript Analysis:** Reading transcripts carefully revealed Mosh's teaching pattern:
   - Explains concept → Types code → Runs code → Shows output → Exercise
   
2. **Walk-Along vs Exercise:** Clear distinction:
   - **Walk-Along:** Mosh types the code while explaining
   - **Exercise:** Mosh asks students to code independently
   
3. **Task Granularity:** Some lessons have one comprehensive task, others have multiple small tasks
   - Kept task count varied based on video content
   - More complex topics (like Lesson 03) have more tasks
   
4. **Output Formatting:** Some outputs needed special attention:
   - Multi-line outputs use `\n` in expected output
   - Interactive inputs shown with prompts
   - Float precision shown exactly as Python outputs

## Related Documentation
