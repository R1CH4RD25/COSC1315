# STUDENT PROFILE AND COURSE CONTEXT - Detailed Analysis

**Created:** October 20, 2025  
**Source:** Instructor Interview with Professor Sullivan  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive understanding of student population, constraints, and realistic course goals

---

## 🏫 School Context

### **Woodson ISD - Small Rural School**
- **Total Campus Size:** 150 students (K-12)
- **Class Size for COSC 1315:** Typically 8-10 students, currently 3 students
- **Location:** Rural Texas
- **Community:** Small, tight-knit

### **Instructor Background**
- **Role:** Technology Director (primary) + Instructor (secondary)
- **Education:** Masters in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics (WTAMU)
- **Funding:** Stipend from HS + Master's degree paid for by district
- **Expectation:** Teach one course as part of agreement
- **Time Availability:** Very limited due to Tech Director responsibilities

---

## 🎓 Why This Course Exists

### **Texas CCMR (College, Career, Military Readiness) Credit**
- **State Requirement:** Students need CCMR indicators for high school accountability
- **Credit Pathway:** 9 hours of college credit = CCMR achievement
- **This Course's Role:** Part of that 9-hour requirement
- **Cisco College Partnership:** Allows dual credit offering

### **Student Enrollment Reality**
- ❌ **NOT:** Students choosing this because they love programming
- ❌ **NOT:** Self-selected based on career interest
- ✅ **ACTUALLY:** "If students have an opening, we place them in here"
- ✅ **ACTUALLY:** Meeting graduation requirements
- ✅ **ACTUALLY:** Filling schedule slots

**Translation:** This is a **required elective**, not a passion pursuit.

## 👨‍🎓 Student Profile - The Hard Truth

### **Motivation Level: 1-2/10**
> "Most are just in it because they get placed here."

### **Programming Interest: 0.2/10**
> "About a .2 on a scale of 1-10 of coding interest."

### **Programming Knowledge: 1/10**
> "These are maybe a 1 on a scale of 1-10 coding knowledge"

### **The "Senioritis" Problem**
> "Senioritis has began to hit in lower grades and especially in an elective college course that they don't care one way or another that they are in."

**Key Insight:** We are NOT working with motivated, self-driven learners. We are working with:
- Students who would rather be elsewhere
- Students who lack intrinsic drive
- Students who see this as "just another requirement"
- Students who are mentally checked out

---

## 💻 Technical Environment

### **Available Devices:**

#### **In Classroom:**
- **Desktop Computers ONLY**
- **Security:** Locked down with Faronics Deep Freeze
- **Software:** NO VS Code, NO local development tools
- **Purpose:** General use, resets on reboot

#### **Student Take-Home Devices:**
- **Chromebooks (1:1)** - Every student has one
- **Why Google Colab:** Chromebooks can't run traditional IDEs
- **Previous Platform:** Replit (abandoned due to cost)
- **Current Platform:** Google Colab (free, works on Chromebooks)

#### **NOT Available:**
- ❌ iPads/tablets
- ❌ Phones (Texas state law prohibits in school)
- ❌ Personal laptops
- ❌ Installation privileges

**Constraint:** Everything MUST be web-based and free.

---

## 🚧 Access Restrictions

### **What's Blocked:**
- Social media (locked down)
- Many websites (district filtering)
- App stores
- Installations

### **What's Allowed:**
- Google Workspace (Classroom, Colab, Docs, Drive)
- Canvas LMS
- YouTube (educational)
- District-approved websites

**Design Implication:** Cannot rely on external APIs, social media integration, or third-party services.

---

## 😤 Student Struggles - Root Causes

### **Primary Issue: Lack of Interest**
> "Most of this, is lack of true interest."

Not struggling because content is hard.  
Struggling because **they don't care.**

### **The Apathy Cycle:**
1. Student placed in course (not chosen)
2. Student doesn't see relevance
3. Student does minimum to pass
4. Student forgets everything immediately
5. Student moves on, unchanged

### **Help-Seeking Behavior:**
> "They have options to email, etc... but many times do not."

- ✅ Sometimes ask in person (4 days/week face-to-face)
- ❌ Rarely email
- ❌ Mostly suffer in silence
- **Why?** Apathy, not shyness

---

## ✅ What Has Worked Previously

### **Projects Students Actually Enjoyed:**

#### **Four 4's Challenge**
- **Concept:** Use four 4's and any operators to create numbers 1-100
- **Example:** `(4 + 4) / (4 + 4) = 1`, `4 * 4 + 4 + 4 = 24`
- **Why It Worked:** 
  - Puzzle-like
  - Clear goal
  - Creative solutions
  - Feels like a game

### **Lessons That Engaged:**
> "Depends on the kids really... some that enjoyed coding really enjoyed some of the lessons..."

**Translation:** Small subset of students responded positively, but majority were still disengaged.

---

## 🤖 The AI Problem

### **What Happened:**
> "Even in Colab, the introduction of AI assisted coding quickly killed the simple coding tasks."

### **The Issue:**
- **Before AI:** Students struggled through basics, actually learned
- **After AI:** Students copy-paste AI solutions, learn nothing
- **Current State:** AI disabled in shared notebooks, but students can re-enable

### **Why This is Critical:**
> "I know coding (to a degree) which helps me use AI like you in my code, but since I have experience coding I am able to debug, assist, and give better instruction of what needs to happen than most beginners who know nothing currently."

**Key Insight:** AI is a **crutch for beginners**, not a tool. They use it to avoid learning, not enhance learning.

### **Detection:**
> "Though typically it is simple to tell what is AI coded for them and what isn't."

Students are using AI to cheat, not to learn.

---

## 🎯 Realistic Course Goals (Adjusted)

### **What We Can Achieve:**
1. ✅ Expose students to programming concepts
2. ✅ Give them vocabulary to discuss programming
3. ✅ Show them what programming looks like
4. ✅ Provide college credit for CCMR
5. ✅ Identify the 1-2 students who might actually be interested

### **What We CANNOT Achieve:**
1. ❌ Make all students love programming
2. ❌ Create self-motivated learners
3. ❌ Build complex applications
4. ❌ Expect retention after course ends
5. ❌ Spark passion in disinterested teens

### **Success Metric (Realistic):**
- Students complete assignments ✅
- Students pass quizzes ✅
- Students get college credit ✅
- 0-2 students show genuine interest and continue ✅
- Professor maintains sanity while being Tech Director ✅

## 🎮 Student Interests

### **What They Care About:**

#### **Gaming:**
> "I'm sure they are interested, I know most that come through game."

- Common interest
- Motivating factor
- But: Limited access during school

#### **Sports:**
> "Most here are in athletics of some sort if not in every sports since we are so small."

- Nearly universal participation
- Small school = everyone plays everything
- Major time commitment

#### **Social Media:**
> "Yes, but that is locked down here."

- Interested but blocked
- Cannot use as engagement tool
- District restrictions

#### **Art/Music:**
> "Very few – My Daughter but we have her at a different school due to their excelling art program and we are too small to have one with our lack of teacher base."

- Not common interest
- School too small for programs

---

## 💡 Engagement Ideas - Feasibility Assessment

### **✅ FEASIBLE (High Priority):**

#### **1. "Debug Detective" Challenge**
> "Could be fun!"

**Why it works:**
- Gamifies frustration
- Doesn't require external tools
- Can implement in Colab notebooks
- Funny bug names = memorable

**Implementation:** Build into lessons, no external system needed.

---

#### **2. Sports Statistics Projects**
> "Most here are in athletics"

**Idea:** Tie programming to their actual interest
- Calculate batting averages
- Track personal records
- Analyze team stats
- Game score predictions

**Why it works:** They care about sports, not abstract math.

---

#### **3. Four 4's Style Challenges**
> Students enjoyed this previously

**Expand concept:**
- Math puzzles using Python
- Pattern recognition challenges
- Logic games
- Competitive elements

**Why it works:** Proven success, feels like games not homework.

---

### **❌ NOT FEASIBLE (Given Constraints):**

#### **1. Badge/Streak System**
> "Would love this, but knowing how to implement is beyond me."

**Barriers:**
- Requires backend development
- Canvas integration complex
- Maintenance overhead
- Professor time unavailable

**Verdict:** Cool idea, unrealistic given Tech Director duties.

---

#### **2. Real-World API Projects**
> "Could be difficult to implement due to the limitations of what they can access while here."

**Barriers:**
- Social media blocked
- External APIs require authentication
- Network restrictions
- Setup complexity

**Verdict:** Too many technical barriers.

---

#### **3. AI Chatbot Helper**
> "AI is where coding is going and is great, however, they use this as too much of a crutch"

**Problem:**
- Students abuse AI to avoid learning
- Copy-paste without understanding
- Undermines learning objectives

**Verdict:** Actively harmful in this context.

---

#### **4. Micro-Videos by Professor**
> "I would love a library of videos, but probably look to grab some that are premade… like I am with Mosh.. don't reinvent the wheel if I don't have to."

**Barriers:**
- Time to create
- Tech Director responsibilities
- Mosh already covers content

**Verdict:** Use existing resources (Mosh), don't create new ones.

---

#### **5. Progress Dashboard/Gamification**
> "Maybe a future semester"

**Barriers:**
- Development time
- Maintenance
- Low student motivation means low impact

**Verdict:** Not worth effort given student apathy.

---

#### **6. "Make It Yours" Calculator Project**
> "Building a calculator would be a major end goal project… remember, these are maybe a 1 on a scale of 1-10 coding knowledge"

**Problem:** WAY too advanced for students at this level.

**Verdict:** Overestimates student ability.

---

#### **7. Embedded Edpuzzle Checkpoints**
> "I could toss something into say Edpuzzle (if I wanted to pay), but that would be hard to implement"

**Barriers:**
- Cost (not free)
- Integration complexity
- Would interrupt Colab workflow

**Verdict:** Not worth the cost/complexity.

---

## 🎯 Revised Course Philosophy

### **The Brutal Honesty:**
This is a **survival course**, not an **excellence course**.

**Goals:**
1. Get students through with minimal pain
2. Award college credit
3. Meet CCMR requirements
4. Keep assignments achievable
5. Maintain self-paced structure
6. Minimize professor overhead
7. If 1-2 students discover interest = bonus

### **Design Principles:**
- ✅ Simple, clear, achievable
- ✅ Self-contained (no external dependencies)
- ✅ Free (zero budget)
- ✅ Web-based (Chromebook compatible)
- ✅ Auto-graded (no manual grading burden)
- ✅ Due dates (structure for apathetic students)
- ✅ Minimal help needed (they won't ask anyway)

### **What "Engagement" Means Here:**
Not "excited to learn" but "willing to complete assignments."

**Success = Completion, not Mastery.**

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy (Realistic)

### **Keep It Simple:**

#### **Lesson Structure (Already Good):**
1. ✅ Watch Mosh video (timestamp link)
2. ✅ Walk-along coding (follow instructor)
3. ✅ Try it yourself (simple modifications)
4. ✅ Debug the bug (find the error)
5. ✅ Vocab quiz (10 questions, auto-grade)
6. ✅ Assignment quiz (10 questions, auto-grade)

**This is solid. Don't overcomplicate.**

---

#### **Enhancements (Minimal Effort, Max Impact):**

##### **1. Sports-Themed Examples**
- Replace generic variables with sports stats
- "Calculate your batting average"
- "Track your personal record progression"
- Use local team names/players

**Effort:** Low (just rename variables)  
**Impact:** Medium (actually relevant to students)

---

##### **2. "Debug Detective" Framing**
- Add funny bug names
- Frame as mystery solving
- Make errors memorable

**Effort:** Low (just add flavor text)  
**Impact:** Medium (makes debugging less frustrating)

---

##### **3. Four 4's Style Bonus Challenges**
- Optional "brain teaser" at end of each lesson
- No grading, just for fun
- Competitive leaderboard (optional)

**Effort:** Low (create puzzle, post solution later)  
**Impact:** Low (only motivated students will try) but zero harm

---

##### **4. Clear Due Dates + Grace Period**
- Due dates (structure for apathetic students)
- 48-hour grace period (reality of busy teens)
- Canvas auto-closes after grace period

**Effort:** None (Canvas feature)  
**Impact:** High (prevents procrastination spiral)

---

##### **5. "I'm Stuck" Protocol**
Clear instructions in every notebook:
```
🆘 STUCK? HERE'S WHAT TO DO:

1. Read the error message (it tells you what's wrong!)
2. Check your indentation (most common Python mistake)
3. Compare your code to the video (did you miss something?)
4. Ask in person during class
5. Email Prof. Sullivan (include screenshot)

BEFORE YOU ASK:
- What were you trying to do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- What have you tried already?
```

**Effort:** Low (copy-paste into template)  
**Impact:** High (teaches problem-solving, reduces "I don't know" questions)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (Realistic)

### **Course-Level Success:**
- ✅ 80%+ completion rate (students finish)
- ✅ 70%+ average quiz scores (students learn basics)
- ✅ Students earn college credit
- ✅ Zero student complaints to administration
- ✅ Professor maintains work-life balance

### **Student-Level Success:**
- ✅ Can explain what a variable is
- ✅ Can identify a syntax error
- ✅ Can write "Hello, World!" from memory
- ✅ Can modify existing code (not write from scratch)
- ✅ Can decide if they want Programming I

### **Bonus Success (Not Expected):**
- 🎁 1-2 students show genuine interest
- 🎁 1-2 students continue to Programming I
- 🎁 Student creates something independently

---

## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid

### **Don't Do These:**
1. ❌ Assume students are motivated (they're not)
2. ❌ Create complex gamification (no time to maintain)
3. ❌ Rely on external services (budget + access issues)
4. ❌ Expect self-directed learning (they need structure)
5. ❌ Make projects too hard (they'll give up)
6. ❌ Enable AI coding help (they'll abuse it)
7. ❌ Create new video content (Mosh exists)
8. ❌ Require peer collaboration (they won't engage)
