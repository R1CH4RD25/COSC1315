## üö® CATCH-UP PLAN (Urgent!)

### **Current Situation:**
- **Expected:** Lesson 11 due this week (Oct 23)
- **Reality:** Only Lessons 1-2 complete
- **Behind By:** 9 lessons (Lessons 3-11)

### **Immediate Action Plan:**

#### **Option 1: Aggressive Catch-Up (Recommended)**
**This Week (Oct 20-23):**
- Create Lesson 3-4 (Variables + Input) - Priority 1
- Create Lesson 5 (Type Conversion) - Priority 2
- Extend grace period for students

**Next Week (Oct 27-30):**
- Create Lessons 6-7 (Strings)
- Create Lesson 8 (Arithmetic)
- Continue grace period

**Following Week (Nov 3-6):**
- Create Lessons 9-10 (If Statements, Logical Operators)
- Create Lesson 11 (Weight Converter)
- Get back on schedule

#### **Option 2: Adjust Schedule (Realistic)**
**Combine Lessons to Reduce Workload:**
- Week 8-9: Lessons 3-5 (Variables, Input, Type Conversion) - Combined
- Week 10: Lessons 6-7 (Strings) - Combined
- Week 11: Lesson 8 (Arithmetic)
- Week 12: Lessons 9-10 (Control Flow) - Combined
- Week 13: Lesson 11 (Weight Converter)
- Week 14: Lessons 12-13 (Loops) - Combined
- Week 15: Lessons 14-15 (More Loops + Lists) - Combined
- Finals: Review + Exam (cut Lessons 16-18)

**Pros:** More realistic given time constraints  
**Cons:** Reduces total content coverage

#### **Option 3: Extend Grace Period Policy**
**Implement Flexible Due Dates:**
- Issue all remaining lessons ASAP
- Students work at own pace
- Must complete ALL by December 4 (before finals)
- Weekly check-ins to monitor progress

**Pros:** Self-paced as intended, reduces professor stress  
**Cons:** Students may procrastinate, cram at end

**Based on foundational importance:**

1. **Priority 1 (Must Have ASAP):**
   - Lesson 3: Variables (foundation for everything)
   - Lesson 4: Receiving Input (interactive programs)
   - Lesson 5: Type Conversion (common error fix)

2. **Priority 2 (Critical for Progress):**
   - Lesson 6-7: Strings (most used data type)
   - Lesson 8: Arithmetic (practical applications)

3. **Priority 3 (Control Flow):**
   - Lesson 9-10: If Statements + Logical Operators
   - Lesson 11: Weight Converter (practical application)

4. **Priority 4 (Iteration):**
   - Lesson 12: While Loops
   - Lesson 13-14: For Loops + Nested Loops

5. **Priority 5 (Data Structures):**
   - Lesson 15-16: Lists + 2D Lists
   - Lesson 17: List Methods
   - Lesson 18: Tuples

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### **For Professor Sullivan:**

1. **Assess Student Progress:**
   - Where are students actually at?
   - Have they completed Lessons 1-2?
   - Are they waiting on content?

2. **Communication with Students:**
   - Email class about schedule adjustment
   - Be transparent about catch-up plan
   - Offer support/office hours

3. **Use Existing Resources:**
   - Follow IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (Phase 1)
   - Use templates to speed creation
   - Focus on "bland but functional" (don't over-perfect)

4. **Leverage Batch Creation:**
   - Create Lessons 3-5 together (related concepts)
   - Create Lessons 6-7 together (strings)
   - Create Lessons 9-10 together (control flow)

5. **Consider Teaching Assistant/Help:**
   - Can anyone help create content?
   - Can you delegate quiz creation?
   - Can students peer-review each other?

## üìÖ REALISTIC TIMELINE (If Starting Today)

**Week 1 (Oct 20-23):** Create Lessons 3-5  
**Week 2 (Oct 27-30):** Create Lessons 6-8  
**Week 3 (Nov 3-6):** Create Lessons 9-11  
**Week 4 (Nov 10-13):** Create Lessons 12-14  
**Week 5 (Nov 17-20):** Create Lessons 15-17  
**Week 6 (Dec 1-4):** Create Lesson 18 + Review  
**Week 7 (Dec 8-11):** Finals Week

**Requires:** ~3 lessons per week for 6 weeks  
**Time Commitment:** ~3-5 hours per week (1-2 hours per lesson)  
**Feasibility:** Challenging but achievable with templates
